**Polynomial slowdown in space-inhomogeneous branching Brownian motion** <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10623">arXiv [2506.10623]</a>

*(Joint work with Julien Berestycki and Michel Pain)*

*Abstract:* We consider a branching Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in which particles independently diffuse as standard Brownian motions and branch at an inhomogeneous rate $b(\theta)$ which depends only on the angle $\theta$ of the particle. We assume that $b$ is maximal when $\theta=0$, which is the preferred direction for breeding. 

Furthermore we assume that $b(\theta ) = 1 - \beta \abs{\theta }^\alpha + O(\theta ^2)$, as $\theta \to 0$, for $\alpha \in (2/3,2)$ and $\beta>0$. We show that if $M_t$ is the maximum distance to the origin at time $t$, then $(M_t-m(t))_{t\geq 1}$ is tight where
$$m(t)= \sqrt{2} t - \frac{\vartheta_1}{\sqrt{2}} t^{(2-\alpha)/(2+\alpha)} - \left(\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} - \frac{\alpha}{2\sqrt{2}(2+\alpha)} \right)\log(t), $$
and $\vartheta_1$ is explicit in terms of the first eigenvalue of a certain operator.


**Biased branching random walks on Bienaymé-Galton-Watson trees** <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07363">arXiv [2502.07363]</a>

*(Joint work with Julien Berestycki, Nina Gantert and Quan Shi)* 

*Abstract:* We study $\lambda$-biased branching random walks on Bienaymé-Galton-Watson trees in discrete time. We consider the maximal displacement at time $n$, $\max_{\vert u \vert =n} \vert X(u)\vert$, and show that it almost surely grows at a deterministic, linear speed. We characterize this speed with the help of the large deviation rate function of the $\lambda$-biased random walk of a single particle. A similar result is given for the minimal displacement at time $n$, $\min_{\vert u \vert =n} \vert X(u)\vert$.

**Continuum asymptotics for tree growth models** <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04336">arXiv [2309.04336]</a>

*Abstract:* We classify the forward dynamics of all (plane) tree-valued Markov chains $(T_n,n \geq 1)$ with uniform backward dynamics. Every such Markov chain is classified by a weighted real tree, decorated with some additional functions. We also show that under an inhomogeneous rescaling after trimming leaves $(T_n, n\geq 1)$ converges to a random real tree in the Gromov--Prokhorov metric. This generalises and sheds some new light on work by Evans, Grübel and Wakolbinger (2017) on the binary special case.
