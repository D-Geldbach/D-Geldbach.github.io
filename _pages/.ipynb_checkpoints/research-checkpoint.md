**Continuum asymptotics for tree growth models** <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04336">arXiv [2309.04336]</a>
*Abstract:* We classify the forward dynamics of all (plane) tree-valued Markov chains $(T_n,n\geq 1)$ with uniform backward dynamics. Every such Markov chain is classified by a decorated planar real tree. We also show that under an inhomogeneous rescaling after trimming leaves $(T_n,n\geq 1)$ converges to a random real tree in the Gromov--Prokhorov metric. This generalises and sheds some new light on work by Evans, Gr√ºbel and Wakolbinger (2017) on the binary special case.
