**Continuum asymptotics for tree growth models** <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04336">arXiv [2309.04336]</a>

*Abstract:* We classify the forward dynamics of all (plane) tree-valued Markov chains $(T_n,n\geq 1)$ with uniform backward dynamics. Every such Markov chain is classified by a decorated planar real tree. We also show that under an inhomogeneous rescaling after trimming leaves $(T_n,n\geq 1)$ converges to a random real tree in the Gromov-Prokhorov metric. This generalises and sheds some new light on work by Evans, Grübel and Wakolbinger (2017) on the binary special case.

## Current projects

**Branching growth on trees** Here we consider a branching random walk on a supercritical Galton-Watson tree. This is an example for a stochastic process in a random environment. The goal is to determine the invasion speed, this is the speed at which the process occupies the environment, as well as the speed of saturation.  

**Spacially inhomogeneous branching Brownian motion** (with Michel Pain and Julien Berestycki) Here we consider a two-dimensional branching Brownian motion where the branching rate depends on the angle of a particle towards the origin. The goal is to deterine the exact speed of the maximal particle, i.e. the particle at the greatest distance to the origin.
