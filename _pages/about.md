**I am** a PhD (DPhil) student at the University of Oxford. There, I am based in the Department of Statistics and supervised by Julien Berestycki and Matthias Winkel. As of 2023, I am also a stipendiary lecturer at <a href="https://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk">Lady Margaret Hall</a>. 

**My field of research** are stochastic processes, both in the discrete and continuous setting. I mostly work on spatial branching processes, that is stochastic models that exhibit growth in space. These models are motivated by growth models found in biology, epidemiology, chemical reactions and more. My PhD deals with what happens if you add inhomogeneities (like varying branching rates or random environment) to the classical models.

**Before** coming to Oxford for my PhD, I studied Mathematics at LMU Munich with exchange terms at NUS Singapore and ENS Lyon. In my spare time, I enjoy doing lots of sports, in particular triathlon, rowing and rock climbing.
