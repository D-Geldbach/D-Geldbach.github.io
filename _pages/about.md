**I am** a PhD (DPhil) student at the University of Oxford. There, I am based in the Department of Statistics and supervised by Julien Berestycki and Matthias Winkel. 

**My field of research** are stochastic processes including discrete and continuous aspects. Currently, I am pursuing projects involving branching processes and random tree growth. The gif below illustrates a tree grown by Marchal's tree growth algorithm - it grows slightly differently than in the animation though. This particular tree approximates the alpha-stable tree with alpha = 1,6. Check out my [gallery](/gallery) for more pictures!

**Before** coming to Oxford for my PhD, I studied Mathematics at LMU Munich with exchange terms at NUS Singapore and ENS Lyon. In my spare time, I enjoy doing lots of sports, in particular triathlon, rowing currently president of (<a href="https://www.wolfsonrowing.org">Wolfson college rowing club</a>) and rock climbing.
