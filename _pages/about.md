**I am** a PhD student at the University of Oxford. There I am based in the Department of Statistics and supervised by Julien Berestycki. 

**My field of research** are stochastic processes including discrete and continuous aspects. I am particularly interested in branching processes. These are a special kind of interacting particle systems where every particle behaves like some common underlying stochastic process and every now and then a particle splits to create more particles. This results in a cloud of particles moving through space with an interesting structure of dependence. I am focusing on a model where the underlying spatial movement is derived from a random walk in a discrete random environment.

**Before** coming to Oxford for my PhD, I studied Mathematics at LMU Munich with exchange terms at NUS Singapore and ENS Lyon. In my spare time, I enjoy doing lots of sports, in particular rock climbing, running, rowing and road cycling.
