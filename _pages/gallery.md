Here are some pictures of the random processes that I'm interested in. Feel free to use any of them but please give credit. 

## Marchal's tree growth and stable trees

Marchal's tree growth is a tree-valued Markov chain. Once rescaled properly, the trees converge as metric spaces. The limiting objects are called stable trees. Here are some simulations of Marchal's tree growth after 25000 steps for different values of alpha, they approximate stable trees. Here, alpha takes values in 2, 1.9, 1.6 and 1.4. In the case alpha = 2, the stable tree is also called the Brownian continuum random tree (BCRT).
